Main script is written in MATLAB with sections. Use 'Run section' on the 'EDITOR' tab to sequentially run all the steps.

We provide 'main_Augmented_MCR_LASSO.m' for single image processing demo. The script is written to process Dataset 1: CH SRS imaging of mammalian cells. 

Please modify necessary variables in both scripts for own use.
